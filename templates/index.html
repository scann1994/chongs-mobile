		<h1>Exploration of World Health Statistics</h1>
        <p>This is the Exploratory Analysis of the 2012 World Health Statistics from the World Health Organization.</p>

    	<h2>Sample of Unclean Data</h2>
    	<p>A quick view of the following unclean data sample allows us to discover a number of problems. 
    	First, there are too many null values. In fact, Out of 129 countries, 112 countries are missing
    	entries for contraceptive prevalence, antenatal care coverage, births attended by skilled health
    personnel. Secondly, the column names are coded and too long, hence inconvenient to interpret
    for our purpose of exploration. As a result, I cleaned the data by removing columns that were 
    significantly incomplete and focused on the Under-5 mortality rates and Maternal mortality ratios
    for 1990, 2000 and 2010. I also noted that the names “rate” and “ratio” are misleading, 
    as both columns have values over 100. I found out from the source website that Under-5 mortality rate 
    refers to the number of deaths by age 5 per 1000 live births. Maternal mortality ratio refers to the the 
    number of deaths per 100,000 live birth. I considered scaling both variables to a percentage basis,
    but did not proceed because each variable has its own reasonable scale. For example, no more than 1600 mothers 
    die giving birth out of 100,000 live births, which means every maternal mortality ratio is going to be less
    than 1.6%, which is harder to account for the differences and scale.</p>

      	<h2 style="padding: 50px 0px 0px 0px">Data Exploration</h2>
      	<p>My intuition is that the distribution of the mortality rates will follow a Poisson distribution, 
      	since each death is an independent event, the average frequency during our time period is known, and that
      	it is only meaningful to count how many times deaths have occurred but not how many times deaths have not occurred.
      	That is confirmed by the following histograms. Most countries have very low mortality rates while only a few countries
      	have over 250 under-5 deaths per 1000 births or over 100 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. </p>
      	<img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/345/31912858554_836cd2d034_b.jpg" alt="hist">
      	<p>Note: The bin size and grid size of each histogram differs, which may not showcase the decreasing trend of mortality rates.</p>
      	
      	<p style="padding: 40px 0px 0px 0px"> We can also see that the overall mortality rates decreased when we moved to 2000 and 2010 from the
      	following box plots. The mean and range consistently dropped across time for both under-5 mortality
      	rate and maternal mortality ratio. The mean Under-5 mortality rate dropped from around 50 deaths per 1000 births 
      	in 1990 to fewer than 25 deaths per 1000 births in 2010. The Maternal mortality ratio decreased from 100 deaths
      	per 100,000 births in 1990 to around 60 deaths per 100,000 births. Its range shrank dramatically by half from 
      	1990 to 2010. </p>

     	<p style="padding: 30px 0px 10px 0px">In addition, I wanted to look at whether the two mortality rates are correlated and the extent of
     	correlations between them. Taking advantage of Seaborn's jointplot, I was able to find a high pearson
     	correlation coefficient between the maternal mortality ratio and the under-5 mortality rate. This makes
     	sense because both are higher in less developed countries with less advanced medical infrastructure, 
      	knowledge and awareness. </p>

      	<p style="padding: 40px 0px 0px 0px">The heat maps show how the two variables concentrate on countries across
      	Africa, in south Asia and South America. The striking resemblance between the two maps shows 
      	how correlated the two mortality rates are, confirming our previous analysis.</p>
